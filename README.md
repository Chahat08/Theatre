# An Ode to Theatre
Solve backstage puzzles and set the stage for the play!

# Inspiration
I've always had a fond love for theatre. Seeing as the theme was entertainment, it was a fitting choice to make a game related to theatre.

# What it does
An Ode to Theatre is basically a Point and Click type room escape game. You need to complete certain stage management tasks in the backstage area by solving challenging puzzles. Once, you are done with the backstage tasks, the play begins!

# What's next for An Ode to Theatre
More levels. A visual novel style play.
